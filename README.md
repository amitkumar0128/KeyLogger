# Keylogger Project

## Disclaimer

**Important: Ethical Use and Educational Purpose Only**

This project is a **keylogger** developed strictly for **educational and research purposes** only. It is not intended for any malicious use or to compromise the privacy or security of any individual or system. 

**By downloading or using this code, you agree to the following terms:**

- **No Unauthorized Use**: This keylogger is not to be deployed on any system without the express consent of the device's owner. **Unauthorized use of this software is illegal and unethical**. I do not encourage, condone, or support any illegal activity, including data theft, hacking, or privacy invasion.

- **Ethical Use**: This project is intended to help developers and cybersecurity professionals better understand keyloggers, how they work, and how to prevent or detect them in real-world scenarios. If you're a security researcher, penetration tester, or ethical hacker, please ensure you have proper authorization before using any related tools or techniques.

- **Not for Deployment**: The code provided in this repository is not suitable for deployment in any real-world environment. It is purely for **learning purposes**. You are responsible for any consequences resulting from misuse or deployment in environments outside of controlled, ethical settings.

- **Privacy and Security**: The keylogger **does not** send or transmit any data remotely or externally. However, it still involves capturing keystrokes, which is inherently **risky**. If you choose to run this project, please do so **in a controlled, isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine or isolated testing environment)** to prevent any unintended consequences or security risks.

- **No Liability**: The creator of this repository is not liable for any damages, loss of data, or legal consequences resulting from the use of this software. By using this code, you assume full responsibility for your actions and the legal implications of your use of the software.

## Project Overview

This project is a **keylogger** designed to understand how keyloggers work and how to detect them. It was developed for **educational purposes** to enhance my understanding of security risks and defensive techniques. The project allows you to learn about the mechanics of keylogging software and how such tools operate in a system environment.

## Features

- Records keystrokes and stores them locally.
- Simple implementation for learning purposes.
- Does not transmit data remotely.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the keylogger in a **safe, isolated environment (e.g., virtual machine)**.
3. Review the code to understand its structure and functionality.

## Ethical Hacking Reminder

If you are interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking, I encourage you to explore legitimate platforms for learning, such as Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, penetration testing labs, or security certification programs like CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker).
